#### Rules of the game

Hangman is a simple word guessing game. Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

Upon clicking the game link, the game page will load. This page shows the blanked out word you ryou to guess, nshowing how many letters it contains by underlined spaces. Alongside this is your current hangman status image, the more incorrect guessed yuou make to more complete the hangman image becomes. The final part of this page shows a keyboard of letters. Clicking on a letter will see if the word contains that letter. Letters can only be selected once and will become inactive once tried to show you your previous guesses.

To win the game you must reveal all of the letters in the word before the hangman's gallows are complete.

To restart the game at any time, simply refresh your browser.
